# Animal-Observations


This program is using Javalin4 api to host a local server where user can enter/remove items to a local csv file. <br />
This started as a school project which i have made some upgrades to afterwards to make it more dynamic. Will release a new version of this with a new concept later.


### Something Broke and I Have not checked up on it yet..
Built a new version purely for Planet Systems tho. Maybe check that out?
